%% User input: identification of the simulation
% In the code below, the user has to copy the input given in the
% main()-function in Main.cpp

% The value of the prefix (pref in c++)
pref = '0';                   

% The vlaue of the struct which defined which degradation models were used
% (deg in c++). Note that in Matlab we can directly input the arrays (e.g.
% if we used 2 models for one mechanism as is the case for LAM below)
sei_id = [2];                           % which SEI model(s) was (were) used
sei_por = 0;                            % whether the porosity was reduced (SEI_porosity from c++)
CS_id = [0];                            % which crach growth model(s) was (were) used
CS_diff = 0;                            % whether the diffusion constant was reduced (CS_diffusion from c++)
LAM_id = [2 3];                         % which LAM model(s) was (were) used
pl_id = [1];                            % which li-plating model(s) was (were) used


%% Identify which files should be read
% Each simulated experiment has its own identifier describing that
% experiment. This identifier is the last part of the name of the folder in
% which the results are written.
% These identifiers are defined in the variable name, which is redefined
% for every simulated experiment in ProfileAgeing in Degradation.cpp in
% the c++ code (note: the line says e.g. name = pref + "prof-HWFET-T25_SoC0-100"; In
% that case, the identifier is prof-HWFET-T25_SoC0-100 (while pref has the prefix and
% degradation model identification)
% In Matlab we can make a cell array with all the identifiers at once
% (rather than redefining it every time again)
IDs = {'prof-US06-T25_SoC10-90','prof-US06-T25_SoC0-100','prof-US06-T45_SoC0-100',...
    'prof-UDDS-T25_SoC10-90','prof-UDDS-T25_SoC0-100','prof-UDDS-T45_SoC0-100',...
    'prof-NYCC-T25_SoC10-90','prof-NYCC-T25_SoC0-100','prof-NYCC-T45_SoC0-100',...
    'prof-HWFET-T25_SoC10-90','prof-HWFET-T25_SoC0-100','prof-HWFET-T45_SoC0-100'};

% Degradation identifier
ageingID = printDEGID(sei_id, sei_por, CS_id, CS_diff, LAM_id, pl_id);

%% read and plot the battery states
% Makes 2 graphs:
%   one with the remainig capacity
%   one with the degradation details such as LLI
%       one subplot per degradation detail

FECx = true;                        % use 'full equivalent cycles' as x-axis of the plots
                                    % if false, time is used for the x-axis
readAgeing_BatteryState

%% Read and plot the OCV curves
% Makes 1 graph with the OCV curves 
%   has a subplot per current profile and shows how the half-cell OCV
%   curves change due to degradation
readAgeing_OCV

%% Read and plot the voltage during the CCCV check-up cycles
% makes a large number of graphs, one per current profile
%   each figure has one subplot per cycle in the CCCV checkup
%   in the release of this code, it has a 6 subplots (0.5C, 1C and 2C
%   discharge and charge)
% Each plot shows how the voltage curve changes, due to changes in the OCV
% curve, resistance increase, and other degradation effects.
readAgeing_CCCV

%% Read and plot the voltage during the pulse charge
% makes one figure with the simulated voltage when a pulse profile is
% applied to the cell
%   the figure has one subplot per current profile
% Each plot shows how the voltage curve changes, due to changes in the OCV
% curve, resistance increase, and other degradation effects.
readAgeing_pulse

%% Read and plot the cycling data
% makes a large number of graphs, one per current profile
%   each figure has two subplots, one with the simulated current and
%   voltage, and a second one with the simulated temperature.
% It show the simulated cycling data during the degradation experiment. It
%   always shows the cycling data of the 'actual experiment' (i.e. when the
%   cell continuously follows the current profile). If the value of 
%   'proc.includeCycleData' in ProfileAgeing in Degradation.cpp was true, 
%   the cycling data will also include the check-ups (i.e. the 
%   current/voltage/temperature while a check-up is done). If the value of 
%   the variable was false, the cycling data will only have the data from 
%   the experiments without the check-ups
