/*
 * BasicCycler.cpp
 *
 * Class to implement a 'basic cycler', which represents the battery tester (and can be used similarly)
 *
 * A basic cycler implements functions to load a cell with a (combination of) constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV).
 * A basic cycler automatically handles the so-called 'cycling data', which are periodic measurements of the cell's voltage,  temperature and current.
 * This data is stored locally in arrays, and when the arrays are full (or when the user 'pushes' the data), the cycling data is written to a csv file.
 * The csv files are grouped in a subfolder of this project folder. The name of the subfolder is the identifier of this basic cycler.

   * This is a recursive function which solves the nonlinear equation to find the current needed to reach a given voltage after a given time step.
   *
   * The current will produce a voltage which has a relative error below 0.1%, i.e. (Vl - Vset)/Vset < 0.001
   * Additionally, it will always be an 'undershoot' (we always stop 'too soon'):
   * 		if you are charging, Vl will be below Vset (by max 0.1%)
   * 		if you are discharging, Vl will be above Vset (by max 0.1%)
   * 		this is to avoid that you violate the voltage limits of the cell (e.g. if you do a CV at Vmax, an overshoot would produce V > Vmax), which would result in an error
   * If no such current can be found (e.g. the step size becomes too small), the current returned is a best-guess.
   * 		in most cases, this current will undershoot the set voltage but with a relative error above 0.1%
   *
   * The search algorithm recursively refines the lower and upper bound on the current which reaches the set voltage.
   * Initially, this function must be called with some bounds.
   * the algorithm then takes 11 discrete steps between these bounds and searches when the error changes sign
   * 		i.e. step i gives a positive error while step i+1 gives a negative error or vice versa. then we know the sought current is between those two
   * 		these two values will be the new bounds for the lower-level recursion (which will have a smaller range and therefore a smaller step size)
   * 		this process continues until a current is found which satisfies the end-conditions
   * In case none of the currents in the search space is small enough (no undershoot), the lower bound is halved in the next recursion level
   * in case none of the currents in the search space is large enough (no overshoot), the upper bound is doubled in the next recursion level
   * If the step size becomes too small, the algorithm is terminated with the best-guess so far in order to avoid a slow convergence or an an infinite loop.
   * 		this best-guess will still produce an undershoot but with a larger relative error
   *

   * The search algorithm itself is implemented in findCVcurrent_recursive.
   * See that function for a description on how it works.
