 * @date 2021
 * @details  One of the child classes of Cell which implements a real cell.
 * The cycling parameters are for a high power 18650 NMC cell manufactured by Kokam.
 * The degradation parameters are set such that each mechanism clearly affects the battery life (which is not the case in reality).

   * 				From 4 (and above) there will be too much info printed to follow what is going on, but this might be useful for debugging to find where the error is and why it is happening
   * 					0 	almost no messages are printed, only in case of critical errors related to illegal parameters
   * 					1 	error messages are printed in case of critical errors which might crash the simulation
   * 					2 	all error messages are printed, whether the simulation can recover from the errors or not
   * 					3 	on top of the output from 2, a message is printed every time a function in the Cycler and BasicCycler is started and terminated
   * 					4 	on top of the output from 3, the high-level flow of the program in the Cycler is printed (e.g. 'we are going to discharge the cell')
   * 					5 	on top of the output from 4, the low-level flow of the program in the BasicCycler is printed (e.g. 'in time step 101, the voltage is 3.65V')
