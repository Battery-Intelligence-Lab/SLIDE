  /*
   * Function to calculate the effect of loss of active material (LAM).
   *
   * LAM is simulated by decreasing the amount of active material.
   * This will increase the current density on the particle for the same overall cell current (because there is less material to 'spread' it over).
   * This will mean that for the same overall cell current,
   * 		there will be a larger change in lithium concentration,
   * 			so there is a larger change in open circuit voltage,
   * 			so a smaller capacity before a voltage limit is reached
   * 			so the capacity decreases,
   * 		and there will be a larger resistive voltage drop, so the 'effective' resistance increases
   *
   * There are a couple of variables describing the amount of active material:
   * 	elec_surf 	the (geometric) surface of the electrode, i.e. the product of the height and length of the electrode [m2]
   * 	thick		the thickness of the electrode material [m]
   * 	R 			radius of the particle of the single particle model [m]
   * 	e			the volume fraction of active material	[-]
   * 	a 			the effective surface, i.e. the surface per unit of electrode volume [m2 m-3]
   * 				a = 3*e/R
   *
   * 	The current density is calculated as:
   * 	i = I / (a * thick * elec_surf) = I / (3* e / R * thick * elec_surf)
   *
   * 	A decrease in any of these geometric parameters will have exactly the same effect on the battery:
   * 	you can double i by halving a, or by halving thick, or by halving elec_surf.
   * 	and you can halve a by halving e or doubling R.
   * 	So it doesn't really matter which of the geometric parameters you decrease to account for LAM.
   * 	However, this model doesn't allow to change elec_surf and R because these values are needed on multiple locations in the code.
   * 	E.g. the value of R is needed to calculate values of the matrices used for the diffusion state space model (because the spatial discretisation depends on R).
   * 	So if you were to change R, you have to re-calculate the matrices, which would needlessly complicate the model.
   * 	Therefore, degradation can only decrease the values of 'thick', 'a' and 'e'
   *
   * IN
   * print 	boolean indicating if we want to print error messages or not
   * 				if true, error messages are printed
