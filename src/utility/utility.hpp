 * All utility functions. So the code is less verbose.
 *
 * A cycler implements check-up procedures and degradation procedures.
 * The data from the check-up procedures is written in csv files in the same subfolder as where the cycling data of a cell is written (see BasicCycler.cpp).
 * There is one file per 'type' of check-up (capacity measurement, OCV measurement, CCCV cycles and a pulse discharge).
