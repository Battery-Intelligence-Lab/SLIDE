/*
 * CoolSystem_open.hpp
 *
 * This class is a coolsystem with an 'open' heat exchanger.
 * I.e. there is no barrier between its child SUs and parent module.
 * It is a 'pass through' cool system.
 *
 * This is implemented by having a very high convective cooling constant, such that its temperature is almost equal to the temperature of its children.
 * Additionally the flowrate is 0, so there is no energy necessary to spin a fan.
 *
 * Note: in reality we would probably prefer the temperature to be close to the temperature of its parent instead of the children (i.e. the children access the air from the parent).
 * This is however difficult to implement, since it requires the cooling constant of its parent to be very high.
 * That violates the rules of object oriented programming, since the coolsystem of the parent should be independent of what we are implementing here.
 * therefore, chose the opposite and say this coolsystem is behaving like an aggregation of its children, and the parent cools something which is at the temperature of its children.
