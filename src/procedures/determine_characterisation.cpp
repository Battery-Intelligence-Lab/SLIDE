/*
 * determine_characterisation.cpp
 *
 * The functions below can be used to fit the 'rate parameters' or 'characterisation parameters' of a cell at one temperature (currently 25 degrees):
 * 		diffusion constants (Dp and Dn)
 * 		rate constants of the main li-insertion reaction (kp and kn)
 * 		DC resistance of the cell (r)
 *
 * The user has to supply voltage measurements for a number of CC CV cycles (i.e. charge and discharge, both with a CC and CV phase).
 * These have to come in csv files with two columns
 * 		The first column has to have the charge throughput in Ah, starting at 0 and increasing as the cell is charged or discharged.
 * 		The second column has to have the cell voltage at the corresponding point.
 * In the top-level function ('fitCharacterisationAtReferenceT), the user has to define which cycles this are exactly (i.e. what C rates for the CC phase and which current threshold for the CV)
 *
 * The script then uses a hierarchical search algorithm to find the parameters which minimise the error between the simulated and measured voltage curves.
 * The results are written in a csv file. If the user wants to use these parameters, they have to be copied to the constructor of the respective cell-class.

		 * The cycles have to be 'full', i.e. if it is a charge, than the first voltage must be Vmax and the last voltage must be Vmin (i.e. from fully charged to fully discharged) and vice versa.
		 *
		 * The user can specify in the code below which C rates were used for the CC phases, and what the cutoff current threshold is.
		 * Additionally, the user has to specify the OCV-related parameters for the cell, as calculated by determineOCV.

		 *
		 * The values of the parameters which give the best fit are written in a CSV file.
