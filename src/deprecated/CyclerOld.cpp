 * Class to implement a 'cycler', which extends a 'basic cycler'.
 * A CyclerOld consists of the programs one would write on battery cycles.
 * I.e. it defines the procedures for loading a cell in a degradation experiment.
 *
 * A cycler implements check-up procedures and degradation procedures.
 * The data from the check-up procedures is written in csv files in the same subfolder as where the cycling data of a cell is written (see BasicCycler.cpp).
 * There is one file per 'type' of check-up (capacity measurement, OCV measurement, CCCV cycles and a pulse discharge).
