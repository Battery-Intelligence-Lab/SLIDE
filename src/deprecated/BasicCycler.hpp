		// 	1 	error messages are printed in case of critical errors which might crash the simulation
		// 	2 	all error messages are printed, whether the simulation can recover from the errors or not
		// 	3 	on top of the output from 2, a message is printed every time a function in the Cycler and BasicCycler is started and terminated
		// 	4 	on top of the output from 3, the high-level flow of the program in the Cycler is printed (e.g. 'we are going to discharge the cell')
		// 	5 	on top of the output from 4, the low-level flow of the program in the BasicCycler is printed (e.g. 'in time step 101, the voltage is 3.65V')
