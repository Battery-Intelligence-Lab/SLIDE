% Script to read and plot the cycling data from the degradation simulation.
% The cycling data contains the current, voltage and temperature of the
% cell at a fixed time interval.
% If 'proc.includeCycleData' in the degradation function in Degradation.cpp
% is true, the cycling data contains both the periods from the actual
% degradation experiment, and from the check-ups.
% If 'proc.includeCycleData' in the degradation function in Degradation.cpp
% is false, the cycling data contains only the periods from the actual
% degradation experiment.
%
% This script should not be executed on its own, but is called by one of
% three higher-level scripts: 
%   readCalendarAgeing
%   readCycleAgeing
%   readProfileAgeing
