%% Plot the OCV curves
% Plot the half-cell OCV curves for the different ageing regimes. There is
% one subplot per ageing regime.
% The curves indicate the half cell OCV curves. The 0 of the x-axis is
% where the difference between both OCV curves is 4.2V (i.e. when the cell
% is fully charged).
% There are stars at the points on the OCV curves where the cell was
% operating before the check-up. They allow to track the slipping of the 
% usable voltage window (when cycling) or the exact point on the OCV curves 
% where the cell is resting (when doing calendar ageing). Note that the
% y-point of the start is exact (i.e. the cell is exactly operating at this
% voltage), but the x-value is rounded to the nearest value of the OCV
% curve.
