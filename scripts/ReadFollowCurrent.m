%% User input: identification of the simulation
% In the code below, the user has to copy the input given in the
% main()-function in Main.cpp

% The value of the prefix (pref in c++)
pref = '0';        
pathVar; % get necessary paths. 


% The vlaue of the struct which defined which degradation models were used
% (deg in c++). Note that in Matlab we can directly input the arrays (e.g.
% if we used 2 models for one mechanism as is the case for LAM below)
sei_id = [2];                           % which SEI model(s) was (were) used
sei_por = 0;                            % whether the porosity was reduced (SEI_porosity from c++)
CS_id = [0];                            % which crach growth model(s) was (were) used
CS_diff = 0;                            % whether the diffusion constant was reduced (CS_diffusion from c++)

pl_id = [1];                            % which li-plating model(s) was (were) used

% Specify the name of the current profile which was followed (defined in
% the function FollowCurrent in Cycling.cpp
orig = csvread(fullfile(pathvar.data_folder, 'Current Profile drive cycle UDDS.csv'));

%% Read the simulation results

% Identifiers for the folders and file

        % older versions of Matlab don't have the 'contains' command. In
        % that case, use strfind. Replace 'if contains(ni,fileName)' with
        % 'if strfind(ni,fileName)'

        % Read the file

            warning(['warning no file ' na ' could be found'])
        end

        % Add up the cumulative variables (e.g. total time, total charge
        % throughput, etc.). In the C++ code, they are reset to 0 after a
        % data batch is written, so here we need to add them up to insert
        % the new data batch 'after' the previous one.
        % These cumulative variables are in columns 1-3,9-15

%% Make a figure showing the cycling data

% First compare the current profile with the current the battery actually
% delivered. If a voltage limit was reached, there will be a discrepancy
% between both.
% The second and third subplot show the simulated voltage and temperature
