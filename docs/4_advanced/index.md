# Advanced changes to the code 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This document gives some explanation of how to do advanced changes to the code. It is highly recommended you do not attempt this unless you know how to program in C++ (including object-oriented programming) and you understand how the code in this project works.

All guidance in this document is only guidance, not a procedure which is guaranteed to work. The changed mentioned in this document havenâ€™t been tested so the list of things to change might not be exhaustive (and errors will occur if there are things missing and you only do what is listed here).
