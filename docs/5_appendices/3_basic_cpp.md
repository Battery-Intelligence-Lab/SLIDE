# C++ basics

C++ is similar to C, Java and Python (and probably many others). If you can code in one of those languages, you should be able to understand the written code. There are some syntax differences, but nothing out of the ordinary. You can find good documentation, help with the syntax and example code fragments on [www.cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com).

There are significant differences with more applied programming languages such as MATLAB. I recommend to first have a look at some basic tutorials before making significant changes in the code. There are loads of good user guides, tutorials, etc. available for free on the internet. Personally, I like the tutorials from [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/).
